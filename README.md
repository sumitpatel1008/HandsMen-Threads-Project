# HandsMen-Threads-Project

Hi! This is a project I worked on during my Salesforce internship. It's called      " HandsMen Threads " , and the goal was to build a basic inventory and order management system using Salesforce Lightning.

I created custom objects like Products, Inventory, Orders, and Customers to simulate how a real business might track stock, manage orders, and handle customer details — all within Salesforce.

---> What This Project Does

- Lets you " add inventory " and keep track of how much stock is available.
- Allows customers to " place orders " for specific products.
- Automatically updates inventory when orders are confirmed.
- Stores basic customer details and their order history.

It’s all built inside the Salesforce Lightning platform using standard tools like Object Manager, App Builder, and record pages.

Here are some screenshots from the project to give you an idea of what it looks like inside Salesforce:

- Inventory record showing stock details  
- Order record linked to customer and product  
- Customer list and profile  
- New order form  
- Login screen for the org  

--->  Tools & Features Used

- Salesforce Lightning App Builder
- Custom Objects & Fields
- Relationships (Lookups)
- Basic Record Pages
- Lightning Experience UI
  

---> Objects I Created

- HandsMen Product – list of available products  
- Inventory – keeps track of quantity and stock status  
- Handsmen Orders – where customers place product orders  
- handsmen Customers – stores names, emails, and total purchases

Each object is related properly so you can link a customer to their orders and a product to its inventory.


---> What I Learned

This was my first hands-on project using Salesforce, and I learned a lot:

- How to create and relate custom objects  
- How to build working forms using record pages  
- How to think about data flow in a CRM system  
- How stock and order management works in the real world


##  How to Use This

If you want to try this project yourself:

1. Clone this repo
2. Check the `/screenshots` folder to get an idea of the setup
3. Try to recreate the objects and relationships in your own Salesforce developer org
